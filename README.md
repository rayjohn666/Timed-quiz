# Timed Quiz

### Intro:
    Here is a timed quiz with some simple questions I have made to demonstrate the ability to use timers and javascript to make such a quiz.
    When the page opens you will be prompted with a button that says "start quiz".
    When the button is clicked then you will be taken to a question answered one at a time, with a 15 second timer. Your score will be added up and totaled at the end.
    GOOD LUCK!!!
